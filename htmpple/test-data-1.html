<div class="md"><p>The moon <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iapetus_%28moon%29#Overall_shape" class=" imgScanned">Iapetus</a> might've had an ancient ring system that formed its equatorial ridge. A ring system can come from a moon as the moon crosses the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roche_limit" class=" imgScanned">Roche Limit</a> of the object it is orbiting. Mars' moon Phobos may break up this way and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars#Moons" class=" imgScanned">form a ring system</a> around the planet in only millions of years.</p>
    
    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_spacecraft_that_orbited_the_Moon" class=" imgScanned">Any spacecraft</a> that humanity sent to orbit the moon and the people that orbited it can be considered as the moon's own moon. I don't know what the people would be called, but the spacecraft are/were the moon's own artificial satellites. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/243_Ida" class=" imgScanned">Even some asteroids</a> have their own moons.</p>
    
    <p>It is possible to orbit a moon and has been done, but it is much more difficult to orbit it than its planet because the planet has a much greater mass. A spacecraft would require many flybys or engine burns to slow it down so it's captured by a moon. Carrying the extra fuel is very cost prohibitive. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MESSENGER" class=" imgScanned">MESSENGER</a> took a long time to become the first spacecraft to orbit Mercury <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hill_sphere#Solar_System" class=" imgScanned">for similar reasons</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter_Icy_Moons_Explorer" class=" imgScanned">JUICE</a> will become an artificial satellite of one of Jupiter's moons.</p>
    
    <p><strong>tl;dr: Orbiting a moon is definitely possible, but it's much easier to orbit something nearby (a planet) with much greater mass and a much larger <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hill_sphere" class=" imgScanned">Hill sphere</a>.</strong></p>
