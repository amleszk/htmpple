<div class="md"><p>I started experimenting with brimmed hats (the ones I wear aren&#39;t technically &#39;fedoras&#39;) after I had laser eye surgery about a decade ago.</p> <p>Best decision I ever made (the surgery, I mean - not the hats) but I had a real problem with sunlight from the sides. Hard to explain, but it kind of dazzles you, like when someone is shining a bright flashlight into your eyes. Baseball-type caps didn&#39;t offer enough coverage to shade the sides, so I tried a brimmed hat, it helped a lot, and I stuck with it.</p> <p>After awhile it just starts to make more sense. If you&#39;re going to wear a hat, why just shade your face? The brim offers better sun protection for your face, ears and neck, and oilskin hats like I prefer, also offer much better protection when it&#39;s raining.</p> <p>Pic: <a href="http://i.imgur.com/K306pV8.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/K306pV8.jpg</a></p> <p><strong>EDIT</strong>: I probably should have mentioned that it helps when you&#39;re old and grizzled.</p> <p><strong>EDIT2</strong>: So many questions.</p> <ol> <li>Yeah, it&#39;s me in the photo.</li> <li>I&#39;m an (avid) amateur wildlife/photographer and I was just out hiking when a friend took that. I think we were in the Linville Gorge Wilderness.</li> <li>The hat is a Madison River model from Outback Trading Company.</li> <li>I like oilskin hats because they&#39;re waterproof, but also because it makes them heavier and softer. They sit better on your head.</li> <li>I usually smoke a pipe, but it&#39;s not convenient when you&#39;re out walking around, so I switch to cigars. I prefer Old Reliables by Marsh Wheeling. (Don&#39;t smoke, kids - I only do it because it makes me look more mature.)</li> <li>The best advice I can give is to go to a store where they sell a lot of hats, and try a bunch on until you find the right dimensions to fit your head. By dimensions I don&#39;t mean size - I mean width of brim (2.5 to 3 inches in my case) height of the crown (4 inches in my case) and shape of the crown (teardrop for me). Once you know what works for you, get different hats for different activities, but stick with that style.</li> <li>If you&#39;re thinking about LASIK, don&#39;t let my story stop you. The technology has come a long way in the decade since I got it, and I understand the &#39;flares&#39; issue has largely been resolved.</li> </ol> <p><strong>EDIT3</strong>: I don&#39;t normally like pimping my little (largely defunct) website on Reddit, but some people are linking to it in the comments, so I guess I might as well.<br/> <a href="http://kenthomas.us/?p=2451">This is my favorite hat story</a>, and explains why me and my friends started referring to my headgear as &quot;Danger Hats&quot;.<br/> <a href="http://kenthomas.us/?p=2500">This is kind of a Hat FAQ</a>. It may help answer some of the questions I&#39;m not getting to.</p> <p><strong>EDIT4</strong>: Sunglasses. Sorry, guys. It&#39;s a cheap pair of glacier glasses (with the side shields removed) that (I think) I picked up in a gift shop somewhere in Montana after I broke the pair I brought with me. That was in 2006. They don&#39;t even have a name or logo on them, but they offer good coverage and they&#39;re polarized, so I still use them sometimes for winter hiking. My son tells me they have a Steampunk look to them.</p> <p>Smoking. The &quot;makes me look more mature&quot; thing was a joke. When I was young &quot;I only smoke because it makes me look more mature&quot; was sort of a standard running gag, making fun of girls who smoked simply to look older, to such an extent that it popped up in anti-smoking ads. I appreciate all the advice and suggestions about it, but I&#39;m kind of unrepentant when it comes to my last remaining vice. Well, other than bourbon. And Reddit.</p> <p>The camera bag is a Tamrac model. It&#39;s a good bag, but I&#39;ve been downsizing (making the slow shift to Micro-4/3rds) so I haven&#39;t been using it as much lately.</p> <p>The coat is just a Columbia parka. It&#39;s one of those whizz-bang high-tech things with the silver dots inside. Omni-heat or something? I bought it because it was on clearance at the Mast General Store, thinking the dots were a gimmick, but they aren&#39;t. It&#39;s amazingly warm - almost <em>too</em> warm for North Carolina. I can only hike in it when the temps are in the teens.</p> <p><strong>EDIT5</strong>: Last edit and then I have to run.</p> <ol> <li>Yes, I realize <em>now</em> that the intent of the thread was making fun of teenagers in goofy hats. I didn&#39;t mean to derail it, or turn it into a pro-hat thread. I get asked about my hats all the time, so I initially interpreted the question as sincere. Sorry OP.</li> <li>I genuinely appreciate all the compliments, but I am not a handsome man. It&#39;s just a good picture, where all the elements come together to kind of make it work. For those who are accusing me of intentionally picking a good photo to make my point about hats, I&#39;d say &quot;Duh.&quot;</li> <li>The key to making the hat thing work is knowing when to wear them. My simple rule (I like simple) is that if I&#39;m wearing boots I&#39;ll wear a brimmed hat. If my outfit features tennis shoes, dress shoes, or any other footwear, I probably should leave the hat at home.</li> <li>I live in Lenoir.</li> <li>I&#39;m overwhelmed by all the comments and compliments on my website/blog/whatever. If you want to find the amusing stories, look on the left sidebar and click the link that says &quot;Whimsical Anecdotes&quot; - that&#39;s where they&#39;re collected. If you&#39;re more interested in my photographs, feel free to <a href="http://www.facebook.com/KenThomas">send me a Friend request or follow me on Facebook</a>, then look in the albums under Wildlife or Landscapes. That&#39;s where I&#39;ve been posting most of them lately.</li> <li>I use my real name on Reddit because the lack of anonymity keeps me from being too much of an asshole. Usually.</li> </ol> <p><strong>EDIT6</strong>: Ducked back in and can&#39;t believe this is still going. Sorry if the continued edits are obnoxious, but I take questions seriously, and there are just too many messages to answer them individually.</p> <p>For the people who asked if they&#39;ve seen me in a hardhat, I&#39;d guess you probably hang out on Wikipedia a lot. I <a href="http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Thank_You/Ken_Thomas">wrote an article for them</a> that they used in that recent editor recruiting project. Funny thing about that picture is that they edited my cigar out of it, because they didn&#39;t think it sent the right message. They asked my permission first and I understood their reasoning, but I still thought it was hilarious.</p> <p>Camera questions. I like Olympus, to tell you the truth. The 4/3rds standard isn&#39;t perfect, but it&#39;s pretty good and (most importantly to me) it was a genuine effort at an <em>open</em> standard. I think it&#39;s important to support that kind of thing when you get the chance. Right now I shoot wildlife with an E-5, and I&#39;m gradually shifting to an E-M5 (Micro-4/3rds).</p> <p>On the Facebook thing, sure - I&#39;m getting a lot of Friend requests. I think it&#39;s cool. My #1 rule with Facebook is that you never put anything there you wouldn&#39;t want made public. Rule #2 is that if you followed #1, why would you care who is on your Friend list? I could always use more interesting people in my newsfeed. Bring &#39;em on.</p> <p>Last but not least, I&#39;m getting a lot of genuinely heartfelt questions about being a &#39;real man&#39;. First of all, guys - you can&#39;t judge that kind of shit from a photo. I could be a deadbeat dad for all you know. OK, I&#39;m not, but I could be.</p> <p>But as for &quot;How to be a real man?&quot; I don&#39;t know. You fake it until you make it, basically. Look at people you admire. Act like they do. You just kind of muddle through. Try to be a stand-up guy. Try to be honest. Try to live up to your commitments, and take your responsibilities seriously. Then one day you realize people are looking to you for advice. People are looking to you for direction. And it hits you: &quot;Oh, this is what being a man feels like.&quot; It&#39;s heavy, but it feels pretty good.</p> </div>
