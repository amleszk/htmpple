<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><h1><a href="/r/TrueAskReddit">/r/TrueAskReddit</a></h1><p><strong>13,125</strong> insightful inquirers for <strong>1 year</strong></p> <p><a href="/r/AskReddit">/r/AskReddit</a> (AR) claims to be for asking thought-provoking questions. They lied. This is the true insightful question platform of Reddit. <a href="/r/TrueAskReddit">/r/TrueAskReddit</a> (TAR) is all work and no play, which makes GreyCastle a dull boy. Or something like that.</p> <p>In all seriousness though, TAR is an improved version of AR. The subreddit avoids tiresome things such as memes and circlejerking. TAR expects thought-provoking and inspired questions, but all questions that generate a legitimate discussion are welcome.</p> <p>I can’t blame AR for this though. I love that sub, but it faces all the problems that come with being a default. <a href="/r/TrueAskReddit">/r/TrueAskReddit</a> is to <a href="/r/AskReddit">/r/AskReddit</a> as <a href="/r/Games">/r/Games</a> is to <a href="/r/Gaming">/r/Gaming</a>. They each serve the same purpose, but with TAR and Games you don’t have to deal with new or annoying users of Reddit. </p> <p>Fortunately, there was the new rule change in AskReddit. The mods had decided that only the question belonged in the title. I welcome the rule change and I&#39;m really glad they decided upon it. However, when so few are left to rule so many: things deteriorate. I am not sure if they will be able to maintain the rule change. So, we all know that if that doesn&#39;t work out then you can always move back to the TrueAskReddit. </p> <p>I sat down and smashed letters into my keyboard for this interview with the head moderator: <a href="/u/WellEndowedMod">/u/WellEndowedMod</a></p> <blockquote> <h2>1. What about AskReddit finally pushed you over the edge and caused you to create TrueAskreddit?</h2> <blockquote> <p><strong>WellEndowedMod</strong> <a href="/r/TrueAskReddit">/r/TrueAskReddit</a> already existed, actually! It was pretty dead so I asked my homegirl krispykrackers if I could mod it and she obliged :) As for my reasoning behind supporting the subreddit to it&#39;s current, self-sustaining, state? AskReddit has changed in many ways. In some ways it&#39;s improved, in some ways it&#39;s gotten worse and some changes are neither good nor bad in the grand scheme of things, I think. <a href="/r/TrueAskReddit">/r/TrueAskReddit</a> is simply a catchy name which implies elitism - that is something that puts some people off but draws others in. Exactly what I wanted. However, I&#39;d be lying if I said that there was nothing about AskReddit that made me retch. Memes. Puns. Idiots in general. Well, it&#39;s not memes and puns that are the issue, it&#39;s that people see funny/good content and they think &quot;Hey, it looks easy enough - maybe I&#39;ll try!&quot; and most of them don&#39;t have anything noteworthy to say/create but they&#39;ll post it anyway, oh yes. Novelty accounts used to actually live up to their name as novelty accounts, now to have a novelty account is no longer a novel thing because everybody and their unborn child is doing it.</p> </blockquote> <h2>2. What has been your favorite discussion/question thus far?</h2> <blockquote> <p><strong>WellEndowedMod</strong> <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAskReddit/comments/vn44z/is_it_really_so_wrong_that_i_simply_want_to_be_a/">http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAskReddit/comments/vn44z/is_it_really_so_wrong_that_i_simply_want_to_be_a/</a> It might not be the best, or ever my favourite, but I like it. I won&#39;t waste time going into why, because that&#39;s my own, subjective, opinion. Read it and decide for yourself if you like it.</p> </blockquote> <h2>3. Least favorite aspect of AskReddit?</h2> <blockquote> <p><strong>WellEndowedMod</strong> Idiocy. I was an AskReddit regular. I was in every new thread to the point where I (on an old, now deleted, account) rose to semi-fame and even moderated it for a time. When you know a subreddit, or reddit even, that well you understand it that much more and the more you understand it the more jaded you become. I first &quot;got&quot;<a href="/r/circlejerk">/r/circlejerk</a> after spending years in AskReddit. When I first looked at <a href="/r/circlejerk">/r/circlejerk</a> I thought it was just a bunch of morons and I didn&#39;t understand. When I looked again it clicked and while it&#39;s not a bastion of excellence all the time there are plenty of gems (forgive me) to be seen. Anyway, as I said; idiocy. Idiotic people, idiotic comments, idiotic posts. The same jokes again and again. The same gifs (this is a more recent phase, though) again and again. AskReddit is like a TV series in it&#39;s 8th season - it&#39;s jumped the shark and everthing you see if a bad copy of what was once great or it&#39;s something new and very unrefined.</p> </blockquote> <h2>4. Do you still go on AskReddit, occasionally or ever?</h2> <blockquote> <p><strong>WellEndowedMod</strong> Every other day I flick through, I might read one or two posts of the top 100. Maybe even none.</p> </blockquote> <h2>5. How do you feel about the <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1479bw/modpost_getting_back_to_our_roots/">new-ish rules</a> prompted by the mods of AskReddit</h2> <blockquote> <p><strong>WellEndowedMod</strong> To be honest, I don&#39;t see much of a change happening as a result. Changing how the OP must word their title doesn&#39;t change the fact that the &quot;community&quot; has fundamentally changed.</p> </blockquote> <h2>6. Do you think the rules will be enforced? Will you return to the AskReddit if they are?</h2> <blockquote> <p><strong>WellEndowedMod</strong> I have absolute faith that the will be. When I was an AskReddit regular I made some friends and many of them were with me in the new section. A lot of those friends are now mods. Will I return? I don&#39;t think so. I just don&#39;t enjoy it as much anymore. That part of my life is over.</p> </blockquote> <h2>7. Anything else you would like to say to your subscribers, promote, etc.?</h2> <blockquote> <p><strong>WellEndowedMod</strong> To my subscribers? Vote with your brain. Does that comment really deserve an upvote? Why? To promote: <a href="/r/TrueAskReddit">/r/TrueAskReddit</a> is doing okay but more people would be nice, the subreddit is active enough but more traffic would be a nice bonus. I&#39;d very much like to see more people posting to <a href="/r/ToadyIAte">/r/ToadyIAte</a>. A nice little sub I created a while back that I&#39;m rather fond of. I&#39;d like to do a shoutout to my homeboy andrewsmith1986, may his account rest in peace. He was one of my first reddit &quot;friends&quot; back when he was starting to accumulate a little acclaim and we&#39;ve had some fun times in AskReddit threads. I have one message for everybody and anybody, though. Click the cancel button to your comments more often. I used to spam comments here there and everywhere but then I learned that this adds about fuck all and it&#39;s better to hold your tongue unless it&#39;s something you really do know something about or feel passionately about.</p> </blockquote> </blockquote> </div><!-- SC_ON -->
